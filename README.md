This is my take on the solution for the assignment.

Links:
Swagger - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html <br>
H2 Console - http://localhost:8080/h2-console

<ul>
<li>Since this is a project intended only to be run locally all of the passwords were left eexposed in the application.properties file for easier navigation. </li>
<li>I've included data.sql file that will seed the database on the code startup that will cover the usability of all existing endpoints via swagger.</li>
<li>As for pagination testing, I've included default values via swagger documentation that will provide easier access and endpoint calling as well.</li>
<li>Password for basic authorization that is necessary for endpoints to be tested will be visible in the terminal on code startup.</li>
</ul>
